I'm Mike, and I'm a software developer based in [Dunedin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin), New Zealand and I work remotely for an excellent company, they're wonderful! I'm a big softie when it comes to accessibility as I was born deaf, but received an cochlear implant some years back allowing me to hear pretty well. (Seriously, Cochlear Implant tech is crazy cool).

I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vebbed), a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vebbed/) and I also help run the [DevelopNZ Slack Community](https://dev.elop.nz/) so by all means, come chat with us! ðŸ™ƒ

I also have a blog that I never post to (like most of us, right? right...? hello?) over at https://veb.co.nz ðŸ˜‡

I've also been rather interested in [federated social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network)s (like Mastodon and Pixelfed) and made https://owlephant.app/ but I was unable to drum up any open source funding for the project so... maybe one day. (*ðŸ‘€ glances at web3*)
