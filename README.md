### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike, also known as "veb". I'm a software developer located in [Dunedin. New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin), and I'm privileged to work remotely for a remarkable company. My commitment to accessibility (a11y) is deeply personal, as I was born deaf. However, cochlear implant tech basically turned me into a cyborg and I can hear pretty well now. (seriously, CI tech is magic).

I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vebbed), a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vebbed/) - feel free to reach out!

While I maintain a blog, updates are infrequent, a sentiment many can relate to, I'm sure. Can see it over at https://veb.co.nz though I am thinking of completely rewriting using Deno maybe...

I am really interested in everything to do with AI and ML. Mainly because I believe it can become a great tool in helping people especially in the a11y sense. I've done a lot of wee experiments (automatic captioning, PDF to website, OpenAI GPT bots for NZ Medical System and Mental Health & Disability to help people advocate for themselves in the system - you can have a wee look here: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-AGWKM9CU9-mental-health-ai-nz)
